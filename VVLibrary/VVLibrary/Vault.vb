' This class handles backing up a directory and its subdirectories to a Vault directory.
' A Vault directory is merely a directory tree matching the source directory tree, with an additional
'     level so that each source files becomes a directory with the same name.
' Within each file's directory are stored all of the history for the file.
' History files are named with their modification UTC date and time, to the second.
' The history files have the file's extension added, so they may be viewed directly using the proper
'     application.
' History files contain the full copy of the file, not a differential. This allows history files to be
'     opened and viewed directly without needing to use a "reconstruction" routine. It also avoid any
'     problems with encoding and line separators, and allows text and binary files to be handled the
'     same way. In addition, VersionVaults are "additive", so once a file is added it is never changed
'     or removed.
' To compare files, the Last Change UTCs are compared to see if they are exactly the same. If not,
'     they are different. No other information is checked.
' In the source directory, a file named ".vvconfig" must exist. It is a JSON Object file. It must
'     have a "VVPath" value for the default VersionVault location, an "IgnoreDir" array for directories
'     to be ignored, and an "IgnoreExt" array for file endings to be ignored.
' The "VVPath" setting in the .vvconfig can be overridden by specifying the VaultPath parameter below.
' All hidden files and directories, as well as files and directories starting with ".", are
'     automatically ignored and don't have to be included in the ".vvconfig" file.
